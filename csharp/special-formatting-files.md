# Special formatting files in csharp

There is a lot of config files you can add to your dotnet projects/solution to keep code formatting consistent.

*  directory.build.props : for common properties across many projetcs (user-defined file that provides customizations to projects under a directory)
* [stylecop.json](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers) : Analyzers for csharp code conformance to recommended coding styles and a subset of Microsoft's dotnet Framework Design Guidelines.
* editorconfig : configuration file convention that is used to define and maintain consistent code styles between team members working on the same code as well as between different editors and IDEs that they might use.
