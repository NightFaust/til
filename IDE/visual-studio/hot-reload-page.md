# How to Hot reload page for Webfoms, ASP.NET etc.

For hot reloading while developing Webforms app, asp.net or others, you can just right-click a `.cshtml`, `.xaml` or other view file, and select `View in Browser (xxx)`. The default keybind is `Ctrl + Shift + W`.
If you want to select another browser, you can use instead just below the `Browse with...`.
